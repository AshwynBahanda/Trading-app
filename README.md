# Trading-app

Created a simple trading projection app which shows the projection of certain stocks for 1-4 years in advance. This app is deployed to heroku.


## Run

To run the application, use the command
<code>streamlit run app.py</code>. 

This should open localhost on your web browser where you can see the projection for certain stocks.
